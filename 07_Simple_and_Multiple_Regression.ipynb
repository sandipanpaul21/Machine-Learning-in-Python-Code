        "\n",
        "When there is a single input variable (x), the method is referred to as **simple linear regression**. When there are multiple input variables, literature from statistics often refers to the method as **multiple linear regression**\n",
        "\n",
        "Different techniques can be used to prepare or train the linear regression equation from data, the most common of which is called **Ordinary Least Squares**. It is common to therefore refer to a model prepared this way as **Ordinary Least Squares Linear Regression** or just **Least Squares Regression**."

        "\n",
        "The linear equation assigns one scale factor to each input value or column, called a **coefficient** and represented by the capital Greek letter **Beta (B)**. One additional coefficient is also added, giving the line an additional degree of freedom (e.g. moving up and down on a two-dimensional plot) and is often called the **intercept or the bias coefficient.**\n",

        "\n",
        "In higher dimensions when we have more than one input (x), the line is called a **plane or a hyper-plane**. The representation therefore is the form of the equation and the specific values used for the coefficients (e.g. B0 and B1 in the above example).\n",

This becomes  relevant if you look at **regularization methods** that change the learning algorithm to reduce the complexity of regression models by putting pressure on the absolute size of the coefficients, driving some to zero."

        "  - When we have *more than one input* we can use Ordinary Least Squares to estimate the values of the coefficients.\n",
        "  - The *Ordinary Least Squares procedure seeks to minimize the sum of the squared residuals.* This means that given a regression line through the data we calculate the distance from each data point to the regression line, square it, and sum all of the squared errors together. This is the quantity that ordinary least squares seeks to minimize.\n",

        "    1. **Lasso Regression:** where Ordinary Least Squares is modified to also minimize the absolute sum of the coefficients (called L1 regularization).\n",
        "    2. **Ridge Regression:** where Ordinary Least Squares is modified to also minimize the squared absolute sum of the coefficients (called L2 regularization).\n",

        "  - This may be obvious, but it is good to remember when you have a lot of attributes. You may need to transform data to make the relationship linear (e.g. log transform for an exponential relationship).\n",
        "2. **Remove Noise.**\n",
        "  - Linear regression assumes that your input and output variables are not noisy. Consider using data cleaning operations that let you better expose and clarify the signal in your data. \n",
        "  - This is most important for the output variable and you want to remove outliers in the output variable (y) if possible.\n",
        "3. **Remove Collinearity.** \n",
        "  - Linear regression will over-fit your data when you have highly correlated input variables. Consider calculating pairwise correlations for your input data and removing the most correlated.\n",
        "4. **Gaussian Distributions.** \n",
        "- Linear regression will make more reliable predictions if your input and output variables have a Gaussian distribution. \n",

        "- The **Prob(Omnibus)** indicates the probability that the residuals are normally distributed. We hope to see something close to 1 here. \n",
        "- In this case Omnibus = 267 (way higher than 1) and Prob(Omnibus) = 0 which (normally = 1)is low. So the data is not normal, not ideal. \n",

        "**Skew** \n",
        "- Skew is a measurement of symmetry in our data, with 0 being perfect symmetry. \n",

        "- Note that this value also drives the Omnibus\n",
        "- In this case, Skewness = 2.1, way higher than 0 so error/residual is skewwed\n",
